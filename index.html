        <h3>Neutrality and Impartiality</h3>
        <p>The Ombudsman, as a designated neutral, remains unaligned and impartial. The Ombudsman strives to promote procedural fairness in the content and administration of the University's practices, processes, and policies. The Ombudsman does not engage in any situation that could create a conflict of interest.</p>

        <h3>Confidentiality</h3>
        <p>The Ombudsman holds the identity and all communications with those seeking assistance in strict confidence, and does not disclose confidential communications unless given permission to do so, except as required by law, or where, in the judgment of the Ombudsman, there appears to be imminent risk of serious harm.</p>
